  Feature 3 was tested manually using debugging print() statements.
  If the feature works correctly, buses and trains should only be created during time steps
  1, 6, 11, ... and so on, in increments of 5.
  And, the buses/trains should only be created if there is one available in storage.
  Below is the recording of the simulation:
