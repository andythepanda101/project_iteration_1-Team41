  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>This repository contains files necessary to run a Virtual Transit Simulator (VTS), which models the movements of passengers
    on a public transportation system with buses and trains. It models the routes of buses and trains on the University of Minnesota Twin Cities
    campus.</p>
  <h3>Configuration</h3>
  <p>To configure the VTS for a different set of routes or to add additional routes to the current model, changes should be made to /src/main/resources/config.txt.
  Following the current syntax, a bus or train line's description is started with a line LINE_START, a string identifying it as a bus or train line, and the line's name.
  The first line of config.txt, for example, is "LINE_START, BUS_LINE, Campus Connector", signifying that it is the start of the bus line called the Campus Connector. Transportation
  lines are ended with a line only containing "LINE_END". Routes are defined within the start and end of lines. The first line of a route contains "ROUTE_START" and the name of the
  route. Routes are ended with a line that has "ROUTE_END". Between the start and end of routes, stops are defined. Each line defining a stop has five elements: "STOP", the
  name of the stop, the stop's latitude, the stop's longitude, and the probability that a passenger is generated at the stop. </p>
  <h3>Compilation and Execution</h3>
  <p>Compiling the code in this repository requires Grade 6.6.1, the most recent version of java, and a browser. The program has a simulator module and a visualization module. The
  simulator is started by running "./gradlew appRun" in the highest level directory and must be started before the visualization module. Once the simulation module is running,
  the visualization module can be run in the browser with the address "http://localhost:7777/project/web_graphics/project.html". The simulation module can be stopped by pressing enter,
  and the visualization module can be ended by closing the browser. </p>

  <p>The factory method pattern is used in the RandomPassengerGenerator class to create new passengers at stops. The StorageFacility class is used to determine if a bus or train can be
  sent out. If the StorageFacility's busesNum or trainsNum variables are 0, the vehicle that they represent can not be sent out. Counter is used to produce increasingly high numbers to
  use as unique designations for objects in the simulation.</p>
  <h1>UML Class Diagram for Webserver Classes</h1>

  <p>This closely follows the command design pattern. SimulatorCommand is the Command, GetRoutesCommand, GetVehiclesCommand, InitLinesCommand, Start Command, and UpdateCommand are
   the ConcreteCommands, WebServerSession is the Client, WebServerSessionState is the Invoker, and VisualTransitSimulator is the Receiver.</p>
